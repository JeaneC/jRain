This is a local weather app coded in Swift. The app was a project assigned by the Udemy devslopes course.
Access this project via the workspace file, not the xcodeproj file.

This project also uses the openweathermap api - https://openweathermap.org/current

V 0.40 - The top UI now loads well for a pre-loaded city (this will change to geo-coordinates later)

V 0.80 - The app now imports all the data it needs, only thing left is to actually use the data to change label descriptions.

V 0.90 - Created the WeatherTableViewCell file. Tweaked Constants file. Label descriptions now update properly, but we actually need to do one more thing, which is to allow the weather app to take in geo-coordinates and give data on any location.
