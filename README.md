This is a local weather app coded in Swift. The app was a project assigned by the Udemy devslopes course.
Access this project via the workspace file, not the xcodeproj file.

This project also uses the opeweathermap api - https://openweathermap.org/current
Currently, my key is in the project. Feel free to use your own key
